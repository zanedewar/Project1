<h3> Employment</h3>
<p>At the moment, I work as a soccer coach for 3 different child development teams at Titans Premier FC.
I have previously worked as a nanny for Microsoft workers and a shift lead at MOD Pizza.</p>
<h3> Career Goals </h3>
<p>In the future, I see myself as an interior design architect, running my own firm, my own campaigns, and essentially working for myself.</p>
<h3> Interests </h3>
<p>I have very few interests outside of work and school that I choose dedicate significant amounts of time to. </p>
These include:
<ul>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Rock Climbing</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>TV</li>
<li>Self-Care</li>
</ul>
<p> Although this is not a complete list of interests, this is what I'm generally doing throughout the week when I'm not working or studying.</p>
<h3> Favorite Websites </h3>
<P> My favorite websites are embarassing. My first favorite website is <a href="http://onemorelevel.com/">onemorelevel.com</a> 
because I used to play games on this website when I was younger. 
I always enjoyed the website because it had an uncountable number of games that challenged your brain in new ways.
My second favorite website would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube.com</a> for the endless possibilities of new information. 
When I was younger, it was an interesting concept that you could hear music from artists around the world and find an answer in video form for almost any question.
Since that time, my interesst has only grown and I appreciate the website now for the same connectivity in an even broader way. </p>
